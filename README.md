# Moving and Renaming PDFs — R vs Python

This is a simple script comparison project to help me refresh Python syntax after years of using R.

### 🧠 What it does
- Finds all PDF files in subfolders
- Copies them into one folder
- Removes hyphens ("-") from filenames
- Prints progress messages

### 💻 Scripts
- `move_rename_pdfs_R.R` → R version
- `move_rename_pdfs_Python.py` → Python version

### 🔍 Why I made this
I've been using R regularly for data work, and while I learned Python years ago, I wanted to revisit it by translating my R scripts line-by-line into Python — a great way to understand the syntax differences more deeply.
